# SafeHouse ‚Äì Secure Cloud-Native File Vault

> **A production-grade backend service** that stores and serves files **securely** using AES-256-GCM encryption and **AWS S3**, and acts as the **live client** for my [Feature-Flag & Experimentation Platform](https://github.com/maazkhnn/Feature-flags-experimentation-platform).


---

## Overview

SafeHouse is a cloud-native backend API that demonstrates how to build **secure, observable, and flag-driven** services:

* **Node.js / Express API** with JWT authentication and role-based access control.
* **End-to-end file security** ‚Äì client uploads are encrypted in-memory with **AES-256-GCM** and stored in **AWS S3**, with on-the-fly decryption on download.
* **Feature-Flag aware** ‚Äì integrates my custom **Node SDK** to consume live flags from the Feature-Flag platform:
  * Dynamic **rate limits**.
  * **Upload-size caps**.
  * **Logs page gating**.
  * **Upload-variant switching**.
* **Fully documented & observable** ‚Äì live metrics, health checks, and interactive **Swagger/OpenAPI docs**.

This project doubles as the **client application** showcased in the Feature-Flag platform‚Äôs recruiter-facing **Live Tour** page: recruiters can flip a flag and instantly watch SafeHouse react.
